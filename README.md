Amazon Clone Project:
This is a simple Amazon homepage clone made using HTML and CSS.
I built this project to practice making website layouts and using different sections like navbar, search bar, product sections, and footer.

What I Did:

Made a navigation bar with logo, search bar, delivery location, account, and cart icons.

Created a panel section with menu and quick links like "Todayâ€™s Deals", "Customer Service", "Gift Cards", etc.

Added a hero section with a big background image.

Designed multiple product boxes for categories like Clothes, Electronics, Health & Personal Care, Furniture, Beauty, Pet Care, Toys, and Fashion Trends.

Made a footer with multiple columns, links, and Amazon logo.

Used Font Awesome icons for cart, search, flag, and location.

Tech Used:
HTML
CSS
Font Awesome

This is a practice project for learning purposes and is not affiliated with Amazon.
